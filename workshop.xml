		description="ALIEN lets you level up by collecting gold nuggets from monsters.

**This mod is a work in progress and there may be bugs**
      **If you find any bugs please report them!**

* Update (2021 June 7th): A lot of fixes and new features.

* Update perk generation to emulate vanilla generation more closely. Hopefully this will lead to less problems if perk generation changes in the future.

* Fix UI crash related to picking certain perks.

* Add support for Nightmare starting perks not disappearing (sort of, you don't lose them while you're level 1, after that they're like normal). New spooky nightmare altar!

* Fix RNG issue with 'Always Cast'-perk always being the same, though this can still be an issue if you pick multiple 'Always Cast' in a row in the same general area.

* UI preferences can now be set in the mod settings and is remembered.

* Several new gameplay related settings: 'Greed Perk' XP scaling, factor for level XP cost (0.5x, 1x, 2, 3x), high level XP cost scaling, temple level up behavior and perk storage accessibility.

* An issue that sometimes showed non-localized perk descriptions, I think?

* Previous update: Made use of newer mod API to draw perks + icons, with mouse over descriptions! Fixed issue where UI might disappear when polymorphed.

* If you notice any problems with the mod, please let me know! If you're using other mods, please include a list of the mods you're using.
                    
I made this mod primarily to not have to chase parallel worlds to power up in the endgame, since that bloats your savegame and can lead to crashes. The point of the mod is not to make you overpowered, but I still need to tweak the experience costs for the levels. Right now they're just guesses from me.

Selecting perks is done through the inventory when the Alien GUI is open. You can reroll perks through the UI, which works the same as unmodded rerolling.

If you would like to rush, you will still get a level up and perk when you enter the perk area. This only happens if you haven't gotten the normal amount of perks for that holy mountain already, so you shouldn't be getting more perks than normal. The XP cost of the level you skipped this way is added to your next level requirement, so you still have to earn that XP to keep levelling later.

You can store sets of perks if you'd like to reroll them later, similar to leaving a perk set in a holy mountain. Stored perks are saved in the biome you are in, so you'll have to go back to that biome to be able to access those perks again. If you store a set of perks with a cheaper reroll cost than you have later, that cheaper reroll cost will apply for the stored perk set just like in the base game."
